Enterprise GeoShare
===================

Intelygenz open source system to share temporaly geolocation between people of the same Google Apps domain.


## How Does It Work?


### Share Your Current Location

When you run the application, your geo location is sent to our servers.

Then the server returns the nearest workmates in a radius of a few kilometers.

Your location is available for other workmates for one hour or when you log out.



### Share Your Future Locations

The application uses the Google Calendar API to search the upcoming geolocated events of the day and retrieve your contacts in Google+.

So GeoShare can tell you what workmates, that are within your Google+ circles, will be near throughout the day.


## What Can I Do When Discover A Workmate?

- Know the distance
- Show the position in a Google Map
- Open a hangout with only a click
